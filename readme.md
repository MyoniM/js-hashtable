## Javascript HashTable

This is a very minimal and simple implementation of a HashMap in javascript.

The HashMap class doesn't use any external libraries in any way.
The hashing function in the class is a direct implementation for Java’s String.hashCode() method. The hash generated by the hash function is then used as index in the bucket.

```javascript
function _hash(key) {
    let hash = 0;
    if (key.length === 0) return hash;
    for (let i = 0; i < key.length; i++) {
    let charCode = key.charCodeAt(i);
    hash = (hash << 5) - hash + charCode;
    hash |= 0; // Convert to 32bit integer
    }
    return hash;
}
```

Obviously, the hashing function can't always produce unique values, since int is limited to 2^32 distinct values, and there are an infinity of possible String values. This means that collisions are imminent.

To handle collisions, chaining strategy is used. Each slot of our hash table holds a pointer to another data structure(linked list).

The bucket is not dynamic, it is a fixed size of ten for this implementation.
